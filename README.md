# Strive

Strive helps you achieve by organizing your goals, projects and to-dos in a hierarchy. Strive is designed for goal-oriented people to easily
track their not only ongoing projects, but other accomplishments. It breaks down your projects into smaller tasks that can be marked complete,
and automatically tracks how close you are to completion.

Strive uses SQL and the Sequelize ORM to manage the database, Node.js and Express.js for back-end, and jQuery for front-end interactivity.
